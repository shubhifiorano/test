# Provide WORKSPACE_PATH, REPO_NAME and CLONE_URL (till .git)
WORKSPACE_PATH=/actions-runner/_work/test

#REPO_NAME - slash separated after your GITLAB ACCOUNT NAME eg if your GITLAB link is  https://gitlab.com/Blitzkrieg/fiorano/esb.git then REPO_NAME = fiorano/esb

REPO_NAME=test
#WORKSPACE PATH - this is the place where it will clone the git repo and create the zips that will be imported. This workspace cannot be runtimedata/applications/repository as it will create two folders with the same name- one will be the pre-existing one and the other the checked out one. Moreover creating the zip will lead to a conflict and correct EP might not get imported. However, if the user is not going to do any development/ create EPs on the production environment and you still want to use the same path as runtimedata/applications/repository then firstly initialize that direcrory as git direcrory by running the git init command and then edit the .git/Config file to set the head correctly. Then modify the script to replace git clone with git pull (fetch + merge). And delete/ rename the zip after it has launched successfully.
